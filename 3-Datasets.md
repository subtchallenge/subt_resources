### [SubT Reference Datasets](https://github.com/subtchallenge/tunnel_urban_reference_datasets)

Robot data collected by the Army Research Laboratory in the Systems Competition courses at STIX, Tunnel Circuit, and Urban Circuit events. The data includes rosbags with LIDAR, camera, odometry, and mapping data as robots were teleoperated through the courses to known artifact locations.

### [ColoRadar Dataset](https://arpg.github.io/coloradar/)

The Colorado mm-Wave Radar (ColoRadar) dataset by Team MARBLE consists of 52 sequences, recorded in mines, built environments, and in an urban creek path, totaling more than 145 minutes of 3D FMCW radar, 3D lidar, and IMU data.

### [SubT-MRS Dataset](https://superodometry.com/datasets#subt-mrs-dataset)

The SubT-MRS Dataset is a collection of multi-robot datasets by Team Explorer obtained from caves, urban areas, and tunnels. The datasets are multi-modal, integrating visual, lidar, thermal, and inertial measurements, enabling exploration under demanding conditions such as darkness, smoke, dust, and geometrically degraded environments.
